Every Jenkins build job definition is stored in a file named config.xml. You can copy the file to the Jenkins user home directory (by default <USER_HOME>/.jenkins/jobs) to set up the job automatically. Keep in mind that you will need to create a dedicated directory for each job. Please refer to the Jenkins documentation to learn more about its directory structure: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Administering+Jenkins.

Note: You will need to restart Jenkins to see the job in the dashboard.
